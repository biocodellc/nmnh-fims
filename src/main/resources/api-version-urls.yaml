# This file is used for mapping previous api urls to there current location
# Note that there is no transformation between versions, and all urls need to map to the current location
# Ex.
#  1_0:
#    - versionUrl: projects/(?<projectId>[^/]+)/lists/fastqMetadata(?<test>/)?
#      currentUrl: projects/list/${projectId}
#      namedGroups:
#        - projectId
#        - test

versionMap:
  1_0:
    - versionUrl: projects/(?<projectId>[^/]+)/expeditions(/)?
      currentUrl: users/projects/${projectId}/expeditions/
      namedGroups:
        - projectId
    - versionUrl: projects/(?<projectId>[^/]+)/getListFields/(?<listName>[^/]+)(/)?
      currentUrl: projects/${projectId}/config/lists/${listName}/fields
      namedGroups:
        - projectId
        - listname
